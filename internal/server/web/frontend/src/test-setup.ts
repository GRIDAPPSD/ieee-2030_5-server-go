// Wires the two pieces every component test in this suite depends on: the
// testing-library/svelte auto cleanup hook (so one test's rendered DOM
// never leaks into the next) and the jest-dom matchers (toHaveTextContent,
// etc.) used by the assertions in src/routes/*.test.ts. Registered once
// here via vite.config.ts's test.setupFiles rather than per-test-file.
